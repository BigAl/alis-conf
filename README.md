# alis-conf

This is my opinionated/personal alias.conf configuration file. Nothing extension changes to Australian locale and default to lvm.

It is an addition to original work by [picodotdev](https://github.com/picodotdev/alis) and as such does run standalone.

## Usage

Download the original [alis](https://github.com/picodotdev/alis) and the replacement `.conf` files

```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigal/alis-conf/main/download.sh | bash # Download alis conf files
curl -sL https://bit.ly/38gOrhC | bash                                               # Alternative download URL with URL shortenerl 
```
